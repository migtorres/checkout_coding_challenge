## Challenge

<div>
-------------------------------------------
<p>our client is an online marketplace, here is a sample of some of the products available on our site:</p>

<pre>
Product code  | Name                   | Price
----------------------------------------------------------
001           | Lavender heart         | £9.25
002           | Personalised cufflinks | £45.00
003           | Kids T-shirt           | £19.95
</pre>

<p>Our marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for our customers to purchase these items.</p>

<p>If you spend over £60, then you get 10% of your purchase<p>
<p>If you buy 2 or more lavender hearts then the price drops to £8.50.</p>

<p>Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because our promotions will change, it needs to be flexible regarding our promotional rules.</p>

<p>The interface to our checkout looks like this (shown in Ruby):</p>

<pre>
  co = Checkout.new(promotional_rules)
  co.scan(item)
  co.scan(item)
  price = co.total
</pre>

<p>Implement a checkout system that fulfills these requirements.</p>
